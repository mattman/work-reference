## Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation 
 
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a rare but serious condition that causes abnormal blood clotting throughout the body’s blood vessels. It is caused by another disease or condition, such as an infection or injury, that makes the body’s normal blood clotting process become overactive.

DIC may develop quickly over hours or days, or more slowly. Signs and symptoms may include bleeding, bruising, low blood pressure, shortness of breath, or confusion. Complications can be life-threatening and include bleeding or multiple organ failure.

DIC that develops quickly usually requires emergency treatment in the hospital. In treating DIC, your doctor will treat the disease that is causing DIC. Your doctor may also give you medicines to prevent blood clots, or blood products such as platelets or clotting factors to stop bleeding.

DIC is caused by another medical condition that makes the body’s normal blood clotting process become overactive. The condition progresses through two stages. In the early stages, overactive clotting leads to blood clots throughout the blood vessels. The clots can reduce or block blood flow, damaging organs.

As DIC progresses, the overactive clotting uses up platelets and clotting factors, which are proteins that help with normal blood clotting. Without these platelets and clotting factors, DIC can cause bleeding just beneath the skin, in the nose or mouth, or deep inside the body.

Causes of DIC include:
- Inflammation in response to infection, injury, or an illness
