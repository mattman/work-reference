# Graded Assertiveness

Two approaches to graded assertiveness for raising concerns relevant to patient or scene safety

## CUSS Model
Concern
: "I'm concerned that..."

Unsure/Uncertain
: "I'm unsure that..."

Safety
: "It is not safe..."

Stop
: "Stop what you are doing..."

## PACE Model
Probe
: "Do you know that ...?" Or "I don't understand why..."

Alert
: "I think that will cause..."

Challenge
: "Your approach will harm the patient"

Emergency
: "Stop what you are doing" or "For the safety of the patient we need to...."
