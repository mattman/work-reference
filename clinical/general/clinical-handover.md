## ISOBAR

ISOBAR is the WA Department of Health mandated framework for clinical handover, realistically however it does not fit overly well into a handover of care from paramedics to ED staff but may be useful for consultations with clinicians working in the control room (e.g. medical advisors, clinical support paramedics)
