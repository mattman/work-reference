# Sexual history

There a times when a sexual history *may* be appropriate, its important to consider the following factors though when deciding to carry out this history taking in the pre-hospital environment:

- Relevance of asking the questions
- Privacy of the setting
- Whether knowing the answers to the questions will change your management at all

The following is taken from the fantastic STI Guidelines website produced by the Australasian Sexual Health Alliance {% cite sexual_history_sti_mgmt %}

## Basic questions

- When was the last time you had sex?
- Who have you been having sex with?
  - [Prompt further if required. If they answer ‘my partner’ you can then ask] Other than your regular partner have you had sex with anyone else? [or] When was the last time you had sex with someone other than your regular partner?
- How did you have sex? Vaginal sex/oral sex/anal sex? Did you use a condom? [Repeat question to ask about all sexual contact/partners disclosed by Q.2]
- [If not obvious already] Have your partners been male or female?
- In the last 3 months, how many sexual partners have you had?
- Have you ever been diagnosed with (or thought you had) an STI?
