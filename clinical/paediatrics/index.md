## Anatomical / Physiological differences

There is marked difference in airway anatomy which must be considered in Paediatric patients

Paediatric patients have 2x the metabolic rate of adults - this means increased Oxygen requirements (and also means acidosis can become an issue far sooner)

With regards to Cardiac Output (CO), Stroke Volume in particular is fairly fixed due to developmental factors therefore there's significantly more reliance on changing the Heart Rate component of the Cardiac Output formula hence why paediatric patients often very tachy when unwell (not just because they're scared!)

## Management priorities

- A & B: Top priorities
- C: Decompensation can happen quickly once > 30% volume lost though beware as Paeds can compensate well before falling sharply off the cliff
- D: A deeply unconcious paeds patient can have excellent recovery if cerebral hypoxia avoided (see A & B)
- E: Preserving body heat is important; make sure appropriately sized equipment is used
