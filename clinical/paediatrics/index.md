## Anatomical / Physiological differences

There is marked difference in airway anatomy which must be considered in Paediatric patients

Paediatric patients have 2x the metabolic rate of adults - this means increased Oxygen requirements (and also means acidosis can become an issue far sooner)

## Management priorities

- A & B: Top priorities
- C: Decompensation can happen quickly once > 30% volume lost though beware as Paeds can compensate well before falling sharply off the cliff
- D: A deeply unconcious paeds patient can have excellent recovery if cerebral hypoxia avoided (see A & B)
- E: Preserving body heat is important; make sure appropriately sized equipment is used
