## Pharmacological management
Research has shown that patients sedated using Midazolam also often require additional sedation to achieve therapeutic effects (Isbister et al., 2010). In addition to efficacy, the safety profile of Midazolam compared to other available options is also of note with concerns around respiratory depression (resulting in hypoventilation and hypoxaemia) and hypotension (Australian Medicines Handbook Pty Ltd, 2019), especially where patients are alcohol intoxicated (Yap et al., 2019).

Isbister et al. (2010) framed these concerns quite nicely when they stated:

>> “The unpredictable response to intramuscular midazolam is most likely due to differences in individual patient tolerance and is particularly important in patients with violent and acute behavioural disturbance who have an increased use of drugs and alcohol. This makes intramuscular midazolam, at least, and potentially other benzodiazepines, a problematic choice of drug in a setting in which rapid sedation is required, usually with little knowledge of the patient.”

In addition, doses of Ketamine less than 200mg have shown to be associated more frequently with treatment failure (Isbister et al., 2016).
