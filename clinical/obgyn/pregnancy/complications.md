In pregnancy a number of complications can occur

## Early Pregnancy Bleeding

Early pregnancy bleeding is bleeding occuring before 20 weeks, it is common with approximately 20% of women experiencing it, most in first pregnancy

Approximately 60% continue with normal pregnancy, 30% have early pregnancy loss, 9.5% have ectopic pregnancies and 0.5% other causes 

### Cervical causes

Erosion
: Increased proliferation of epithelial cells in cervix due to oestrogen causing blood stained vaginal discharge

Polpys
: Small growths which attach to cervix

Carcinoma
: Cancer

### Genital tract trauma

Can be from something as straight forward as intercourse don't always jump to assault, falls etc and exclude it.

Caused due to increased vascularity of the genital tract causing increased bleeding

### Vaginal infection

### Implantation bleed

Implantation into endometrium occurring around the time of expected menstruation

### Early Pregnancy Loss

Spontaneous (miscarriage/abortion)
: Involuntary loss of foetus less than 20 weeks

Threatened
: Cervix remains closed (minimal blood loss)
: Strong pain, described as Dysmenorrhoea which is the term for "strong period pain"
: 70-80% in first trimester can progress to term

Inevitable
: Bleeding may be heavy
: May contain clots or gestational sac with embryo / foetus
: Patient may show signs of shock (due to heavy blood loss)

Incomplete
: Remnants of placenta may remain
: Heavy blood loss may occur
: Will completely pass within 2 weeks with no intervention

Complete
: Full passing/removal of pregnancy contents

### Ectopic Pregnancy

- Extra-uterine gestation, usually within fallopian tubes but can be elsewhere
- **Should be suspected in all sexually active women presenting with pain or PV bleeding**
- PV bleed may be minor or significant
- Triad of Sx : Abdominal pain, missed period (Amenorrhoea), vaginal bleeding
- Also consider left shoulder tip pain, pain during defaecation and with movement (caused by irritation of Pouch of Douglas "Kehr's sign")

## Antepartum Haemorrhage

Defined as bleeding, of greater than 15mls, after the 20th week of gestation from the genital tract.

### Placenta abruption

- Placenta is situated **normally**
- Premature separation of placenta, occuring due to:
  - HTN disorders
  - Trauma
  - Decrease in uterus size
  - Drug use
  - Hx of similar
- Can, depending on location, conceal blood loss behind placenta
  - Visible blood loss may not be congruent with symptoms displayed
- Common cause of third trimester bleeding

#### Signs & Symptoms

- Painful rigid abdomen
- Little to no visible blood loss due to concealment of blood behind placenta
- Contractions
- Hypovolaemic shock
- Back pain

These patients are also at risk of Post-Partum Haemorrhage and up to 15% will have spontanous labour within 2 weeks (10% pre-term)

### Placenta praevia

- Placenta is implanted in lower uterine
- Severe bleeding can occur subject to placement and separation
- Intercourse can cause bleeding
- Bleeding in these patients is an obstertic emergency

#### High Risk Patients

- High parity
- Multiple pregnancies
- Diabetes
- Smoker
- Previous c-section or uterine surgery
  - This is because placenta can grow along the scar line in these patients
- Age

#### Signs & Symptoms
- Soft uterus
- Bright red blood
- Painless bleeding

## Hypertension

- Hypertension in pregnancy is defined as a SBP > 140mmHg and/or DBP > 90mmHg
- Severe HTN SBP > 170mmHg and/or DBP > 110mmHg

### Chronic HTN

- Hypertension that is evident before pregnancy or develops in first 20 weeks
- Can be classified as:
  - Essential
  - No apparent cause
  - Secondary
    - Due to Kidney, Renal, Endocrine or Aorta problems
  - Apparent cause
    - Examples include chronic renal failure or diabetes

### Gestational HTN

- Defined a HTN presenting post 20 weeks with no other sign of multi-system dysfunction such as:
  - No proteinuria
  - No liver function problems
  - No platelet problems
- Returns to baseline within 3 months post-partum
- Up to 50% will develop pre-eclampsia, otherwise may have post-partum haemorrhage or small birth weight infants

### Pre-eclampsia

- Hypertension developing post 20 weeks with one or more of the following:
  - Proteinuria
  - Liver disease
  - Neurological signs including headaches, flashing lights or convulsions
  - Haematological signs including bruising or derranged platlets
  - Intrauterine growth restrictions

## Thromboembolic Disease


## Supine Hypotensive Syndrome

## Breech birth
