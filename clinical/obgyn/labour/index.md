## Care of the newborn

- Record time of birth (this is *really* important)
- Assess infants tone
- If tone good, dry baby with warm towel, place on mother and continue observing tone, respirations and HR
- If baby pinking up, breathing well (RR 40-60bpm), HR > 100bpm, leave skin-to-skin on mum and replace towel with warm wrap (keeping baby warm is *very* important)
- Record 1, 5 and 10 minute APGAR scores
- Clamp and cut umbilical cord, leave long - at least 10cm - in case neonate resuscitation required
- Keep baby warm and encourage/invite mum to breast feed
- Transfer to hospital
