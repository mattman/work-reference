## Post partum haemorrhage (PPH)

PPH is blood loss of 500mls or greater during or after labour. It can be classified as severe when loss is greater than 1000ml or where haemodynamic instablity is present.

Primary PPH
: Occurs within first 24 hours

Secondary PPH
: Occurs after 24 hours post labour up to 6 weeks post partum

There is increased maternal risk where a prolonged third stage of labour exists

### PPH risk factors

The four T's :

Tone (70%)
: Abnormalities of uterine contraction

Trauma (20%)
: Genital tract trauma

Tissue (10%)
: Retained pregnancy tissue

Thrombin (1%)
: Derranged/abnormal coagulopathy

### Management of PPH

1. Fundal massage
2. Fundal massage
3. Breast feeding (releases Oxytocin)
4. Urination

If unsuccessful

6. Bimanual uterine massage and compression
7. Suprapubic compression

If TXA available consider via support paramedic, consider en route RV (positive results from the WOMAN trial)
