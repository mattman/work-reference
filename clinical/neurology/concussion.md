# Concussion

>> Concussion can lead to some or all of the following symptoms: a short period of unconsciousness (30 minutes or less), confusion, dizziness, amnesia (generally lasting less than 24 hours), persistent, low-grade headaches. A period of amnesia, or not recalling what has happened, is essential to the diagnosis of concussion.
