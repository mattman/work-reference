## Mimics

- Hypoglycaemia: Ensure BSL > 4.0mmol/L
- Hypotension

## FAST assessment

|        |                                                                                            |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Face   | Facial droop or asymmetry                                                                  |
| Arm    | - Arm drift <br> - Weakness <br> - Other neurological deficit                              |
| Speech | Is the patients speech slurred or abnormal?                                                |
| Time   | T < 9/24 since Sx onset (or <9/24 since waking with new Sx onset - covers wake up strokes) |

Some hospitals (mainly the SJOG ones) are now adding BE to FAST for BEFAST

- Balance: Effectively ataxia / loss of coordination
- Eyes: Is there a visual disturbance / loss (diplopia)

## Rapid Arterial oCclusion Evaluation (RACE)

If patient is FAST +ve, evaluate using RACE. RACE >= 5 divert to neuroendovascular centre.

|                                | 0                                                 | 1                                                | 2                                                 |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Facial palsy                   | Absent                                            | Mild                                             | Moderate to severe                                |
| Arm motor function             | Normal to mild                                    | Moderate                                         | Severe                                            |
| Leg motor function             | Normal to mild                                    | Moderate                                         | Severe                                            |
| Head/gaze deviation            | Absent                                            | Present                                          |                                                   |
| Aphasia (if right hemiparesis) | Performs both tasks correctly                     | Performs 1 task correctly                        | Performs neither task correctly                   |
| Agnosia (if left hemiparesis)  | Patient recognises his/her arm and the impairment | Does not recognise his/her arm or the impairment | Does not recognise his/her arm nor the impairment |

## AVVV

Considered a good test to consider posterior strokes. Must have Ataxia and/or Visual Disturbance 

| | |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Ataxia            | Acute, sudden onset |
| Visual Disturbance | Acute, sudden onset |
| Vertigo            |                     |
| Vomiting           | Vomiting stronger predictive value than nausea |

## DANISH

Dysdiadochokinesis 
: _the hand flippy quickly test_

Ataxia
: A sudden onset of ataxia

Nystagmus
: Can be horizontal or vertical

Intention tremor 
: _Finger tip to nose test, also helps with visual field_

Scanning dysarthria
: Words like "University" and "Hippopotamus", the emphasis is on the wrong sylable (Scanning) and dysarthira is slowness/slurring of words

Heel-shin test positivity
: Similar to the finger to nose test for intention tremor


Dysmetria
: Under/over shoots target during finger to nose test

Arm-grip
: Pull arm while protecting patient and let go, if it rebounds without the patint trying to / able to arrest the return of the arm fail test

Check patient tone as well (Hypotonia)
