## Severity of Asthma

### Mild / Moderate

- Can walk, speak whole sentences in one breath
- SpO2 > 94%
- Wheeze *may* be be evident

### Severe

- Use of accessory muscles
  - Neck
  - Intercostsals
  - Tracheal tug
  - Subcostal recessions
- Unable to complete sentences due to dyspnoea
- Obvious respiratory distress
- SpO2 90-94%
- Audible wheezing

### Life threatning

- Reduced GCS or collapse
- Exhautrion / tiring
- Cyanotic
- SpO2 < 90%
- Poor respiratory effort, soft/absent breath sounds
  - Silent chest == peri arrest
- Tripoding 

## Risk factors in Asthma

When considering the presenting Asthmatic patient and the degree of clinical caution / suspicion (especially around Patient Not Transported)

- Prior ICU admission
- Prior intubation in ED
- > 3 ED visits in past year
- > 2 hospital admissions in last year
- > 1 bronchodilator canister in last month (suggests worsening condition / increased demand)
- Chronic use of steroids
- Progressive symptoms despite best management efforts
- Patient unable to speak in sentences

## Asthmatic cardiac arrest

Low oxygen in the blood
: May occur due to heavy mucous plugging reducing surface area for gas exchange and preventing effective oxygen uptake (Shunting)

Hypotension
: Reduced venous return/cardiac output due to high pressures in the lungs increasing intrathoracic pressures

Cardiac dysrhythmias
: Can occur as a result of the patient using excessive and/or prolonged beta agonists (ie Salbutamol). Most commonly seen is Tachycardia (especially post Salbutamol and Adrenaline) rarely occasions, cause the patient to arrest

Tension pneumothorax
: A reversible cause of cardiac arrest, common in asthmatics
: Remember that SJWA no longer endorse needle decompression in these patients
