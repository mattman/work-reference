# Welcome

This acts as a knowledge base for my random things I constantly want to reference, some of it is duplication of the brilliant work from Life in the Fast Lane, internal CPGs for the state ambulance service where I work and from emergency departments I frequent, text books and stuff from papers that are relevant to practice collected into one place I can keep coming back to, especially while on shift
