## Chemoreceptors

Chemoreceptors detect pH, CO2 and O2 levels in the blood and send signals to the respiratory centers of the brain to adjust the ventilation rate to change acidity by increasing or decreasing the removal of carbon dioxide (since carbon dioxide is linked to higher levels of hydrogen ions in blood).

There are also peripheral chemoreceptors in other blood vessels that perform this function as well, which include the aortic and carotid bodies.

## Baroreceptors

Baroreceptors are a type of mechanoreceptor allowing for the relay of information derived from blood pressure within the autonomic nervous system. Information is then passed in rapid sequence to alter the total peripheral resistance and cardiac output maintaining blood pressure within a preset, normalized range.

There are two types of baroreceptors: high-pressure arterial baroreceptors and low-pressure volume receptors which are both stimulated by stretching of the vessel wall.
 - Arterial baroreceptors are located within the carotid sinuses and the aortic arch. (most interested in these ones)
 - Low-pressure volume receptors, or cardiopulmonary receptors, are located within the atria, ventricles, and pulmonary vasculature
