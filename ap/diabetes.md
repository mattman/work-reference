Affects the Islets of Langerhans in the *pancreas*. Beta cells located on the Islets of Langerhans produce Insulin, which is responsible for:

- Facilitating the uptake of glucose into cells
- Glycogenesis (the conversion of glucose to glycogen for storage),
- Stimulation of Lipogenesis (fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis)
- Inhibiting both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis
- Inhibiting the breakdown of fats into ketone bodies.

Glycogenesis
: Glucose is converted to glycogen and stored in the liver when BSL are elevated

Glycogenolysis
: Breakdown of glycogen stores to release glucose when our BSL levels are depleted

Gluconeogenesis
: Creation of new glucose. 
: When all glycogen stores have been used, the liver can convert amino acids and glycerol to glucose when our BSL levels are depleted.
