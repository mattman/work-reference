## Types of Asthma

### Intrinsic vs Extrinsic

Intrinsic
: Sometimes called non-allergic asthma
: IgE is usually only involved locally, within the airway passages.
: Triggers include stress, cold or dry air, smoke, anxiety, viruses or infections

Extrinsic
: Sometimes called allergic asthma
: Symptoms are triggered by an allergen (such as dust mites, pet dander, pollen, or mold). The immune system overreacts, producing too much IgE throughout the body. Itâ€™s the IgE that triggers an extrinsic asthma attack.
